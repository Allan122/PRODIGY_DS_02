The RMS Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912, revealed patterns in survival rates among passengers. Factors like gender and class played a significant role in determining who survived. We have a dataset that includes information about passengers such as their gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model using the training set, where we already know the survival outcomes of passengers. This data, known as the "ground truth," will help us train the model to understand which features (like gender and class) are associated with survival.

Once we've trained the model, we will use it to predict the survival outcomes of passengers in the test set. The test set contains data for passengers where the survival outcomes are not provided. Our model's task is to predict whether each passenger in the test set survived the Titanic disaster or not based on their characteristics.

In summary, we're using historical data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of survival for passengers in a hypothetical scenario similar to the Titanic disaster, where we don't know the actual survival outcomes in advance.
